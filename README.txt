Forecasting the future sales of products using past data.
Used Seasonal ARIMA model.

Implemented the project in Python.
The source code is a Jupiter notebook file with .ipynb format.

IDE: Anaconda:- Jupyter Notebook
Install Anaconda. You'll find the Jupyter notebook from the Anaconda Navigator. Launch it.
Navigate to the source code file(.ipynb) and open it.
(Refer for detailed info about using Anaconda: http://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/)
Make sure that the input files are in the same directory as the source code(specifically the "product_distribution_training_set.txt" file).

DEPENDENCIES:
The pyramid-arima library is required for running this project. You can get it by following the procedure:
1.) Open the Anaconda prompt type the command: pip install pyramid-arima
2.) Press Enter
3.) If it loads successfully, you are ready to run the code, if not, install the additional dependencies suggested by the prompt.

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE CODE:
All the code is in a single cell in the Notebook. You can run the code by either clicking on "Cell" and selecting "Run All" or just select the cell 
which has the code (all the code is in one cell) and click on "Run".
Another way to run the code is through the JetBrains PyCharm IDE by making the appropiate settings to run the Jupyter notebook code.
